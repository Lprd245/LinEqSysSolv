# LinEqSysSolv
Linear Equation System Solver:

A math project that aims to put math stuff to practical use.

## Useage:
Note:
```
Human_Input_Engine.java is (at this point) useless.
MatrixSolver.java is outdated and was replaced by Determinator.java and will not be updated/fixed.
Output_Engine_poc.java is a backup/proof-of-concept (poc) of Output_Engine.java.
````

To compile the necessary classes (Determinator.java, Output_Engine.java), just run the compile.sh script.

To use the LinEqSysSolv(er) make sure that all the necessary classes are compiled and then run ```java Input.java x y``` with x and y being the dimensions of the Matrix that you're about to enter (Matrix has to be x = y + 1). Then enter all the numbers for the Matrix to be solved.
